Just go ahead, pick out your favorite star, and after you place an order for your new star that you've selected, you will receive a deed to your star! Now of course, it doesn't really make much sense to purchase a star. We will never be able to reach that star in our lifetimes, it actually doesn't even really make much sense on why you are here. But anyways, that's besides the point! Please enjoy viewing our selection of stars, once you place your order, your deed will be emailed to you! You will be the certified owner of a star either in our galaxy (Milky Way) or the Andromeda galaxy. Thanks for shopping at Starr.ly!</p>
