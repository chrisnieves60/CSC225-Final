# React + Vite

Hi professor! To run this code, MAKE SURE NODE.JS IS INSTALLED, and follow these instructions. 

step1: Download the Zip file to your desktop

step2: cd into the folder (csc225-Midterm-main)

step3: run "npm install" on the project

step4: "npm run dev" on the project

step5: if it doesnt automatically open the project in browser, just copy the localhost address and paste into browser. 

Created using Tailwind for CSS, react, and vite.
